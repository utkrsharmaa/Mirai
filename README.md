# Mirai

Welcome to **Mirai**!
_This project is under development_

## Why I decided to make this project

I decided to create this app due to my interest in Manga and Reader apps. Inspired by Tachiyomi, Houdoku and more, My hope is to offer a great user experience and implement features I've always wanted in an app, altogether with a smooth and easy to navigate UI.

## Current Status

The app is in very early stages with no current sources to read from, No reader to enable and no theming available. The basic UI will be implemented in the recent coming days with the rest following soon after.

## Upcoming features

As part of the refactor, I plan to introduce several features to Mirai:

- **Reading modes**: The reader will be robust and flexible, supporting single page, double page, left-to-right, right-to-left, and continuous scroll modes.
- **Customization**: Users will have the ability to adjust dynamic gaps, configure themes, and more.
- **Download manga**: Users will be able to download manga for offline reading.
- **Track your progress**: The app will include features for tracking your reading progress, bookmarks, and favorite manga.

## Contributing

This is a personal project, so I‚Äôm not planning to accept contributions right now. If the app grows and there‚Äôs enough interest, I might consider opening it up for contributions in the future.

Happy Reading! üçúüìñ
