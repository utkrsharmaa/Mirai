# Mirai

Welcome to **Mirai**! This project is just getting started. Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs planned and what we have in mind for the future.

## Why I Decided to Make This Project

I‚Äôm big into manga and manga reader apps, and I‚Äôve always enjoyed development as a whole. Inspired by Tachiyomi, Houdoku and many more great projects and my love for manga, I decided to create this app. My hope is to offer a great user experience and implement features i always wanted, altogether in an easy to use app.

## Current Status

### Why the Switch to Electron?

While Tauri offered a lightweight and secure framework, I've encountered performance bottlenecks on Linux that led me to switch to Electron. Electron's broader ecosystem and proven stability across platforms will ensure that Mirai performs optimally, providing a smoother user experience. The app will undergo a complete refactor during this transition, enhancing its overall functionality and user interface.

## Upcoming Features

As part of the refactor, I plan to introduce several new features to Mirai:

- **At least three sources** (more later)
- **All languages support**: The app will cater to users around the globe, offering manga in multiple languages.
- **Reading modes**: The reader will be robust and flexible, supporting single page, double page, left-to-right, right-to-left, and continuous scroll modes.
- **Customization**: Users will have the ability to adjust dynamic gaps, change background colors, and more.
- **Download manga**: Users will be able to download manga for offline reading.
- **Track your progress**: The app will include features for tracking your reading progress, bookmarks, and favorite manga.
- **Dynamic and responsive UI**: The interface will be redesigned to be more responsive and user-friendly, with a focus on completeness and features

## Soon

Stay tuned for the refactor update! The current version of Mirai is still available (still in production), but the new version built with Electron will be pushed soon.

## Contributing

This is a personal project, so I‚Äôm not planning to accept contributions right now. If the app grows and there‚Äôs enough interest, I might consider opening it up for contributions in the future.

Happy Reading! üçúüìñ
