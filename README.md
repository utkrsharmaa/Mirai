# Mirai

Welcome to **Mirai**! This project is just getting started. Here’s a look at what’s planned and what we have in mind for the future.

## Why I Decided to Make This Project

I’m big into manga and manga reader apps, and I’ve always enjoyed development as a whole. Inspired by Tachiyomi, Houdoku and many more great projects and my love for manga, I decided to create this app. My hope is to offer a great user experience and implement features i always wanted, altogether in an easy to use app.

## Current Status

We’re in the early stages of development, so there’s not much to see yet. As we make progress, this README will be updated to reflect the latest changes.

### Features Under Development:

- **Manga Search**: Search for manga titles and get relevant results using the MangaDex API.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter search results by including or excluding specific tags.
- **Manga Info Display**: View detailed information about manga, including titles, tags, reviews, and status.

### Planned Features:

- **Enhanced Search Options**: Better search features and filters to find exactly what you’re looking for.
- **Bookmarking & Preferences**: Save your favorite manga, track your reading progress, and customize your experience.
- **Offline Reading**: Download manga to read offline.
- **User Profiles**: Create and manage profiles, save preferences, and allow for backups.
- **Reading Tracking**: Track your reading progress and manage your manga library.

## Getting Started

Since the project is still in its early stages, you can’t set it up just yet. We’ll provide installation instructions as soon as it’s ready for you to start browsing manga.

## Contributing

This is a personal project, so I’m not planning to accept contributions right now. If the app grows and there’s enough interest, I might consider opening it up for contributions in the future.

Happy Reading! 🍜📖
